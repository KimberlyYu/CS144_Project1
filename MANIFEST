ALL students complete this section:

CHOICES
(You are allowed to choose a feature for some of the requirements. Indicate on the line
 which one you chose using the letter provided in the spec. Separate the letters with a comma
 In some cases you will also need to tell us what you did)
-------
9a. text-shadow for depth on headers and .card p
9b. responsive font sizes via clamp()
12. a, b
18. a, b
19. duplicate of 12

JAVASCRIPT
(Please tells us what the JavaScript does e.g. "click on the green button and it does the following...")
----------
Click on the theme toggle button in the top-right corner to switch between Light and Dark Mode. The site remembers the userâ€™s theme choice using localStorage, and updates the label text and colors dynamically using a class toggle (dark-theme). The JS uses modern ES6+ syntax and manipulates the DOM to enhance the theme-switching experience.



NOTES TO STAFF
(If there is anything you need to tell us, please use the section below)
---------------
I used a hotlinked Google Font (Caveat) for the <h1> title to fulfill requirement #6b, which asks us to link an external font. For the rest of the page, I used a downloaded .otf font (added via @font-face) that resembles the Animal Crossing in-game font to match the theme and aesthetic of my site.
