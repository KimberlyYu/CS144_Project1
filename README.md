# Project 1 (CS144)

This is my submission for Project 1 of CS144, where we built a responsive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Theme
A soft, pastel-inspired page describing two of my favorite games:
- **Animal Crossing**
- **Stardew Valley**

I aimed for a gentle, cute aesthetic that reflects the relaxing vibes of both games.
